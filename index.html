        <p>Hello everyone, John here.</p>
        <p>So I was looking around this website, and realized that this website actually sucks. I've been thinking of things to do, and I've decided to completely shut this one down and open a new one, under a new GitHub name. I don't use the name "EpicJohnVR" anymore, so I decided that I am going to use a totally different name, and actually style this website to look like its out of the late 90s/early 2000s, to give it that real GeoCities feel to it. </p>
        <p>I'll be putting the link to the new site <a href="">here</a> once I finish it. See you all there!</p>
        <p>- John "EpicJohn" Fiore</p>
