		<h1 align="center">Games</h1>
		<p align="center">I've been inspired by multiple different game companies, both now and as a kid, to make my own video games. It was always crazy to me how by learning how to use a software and code, you could build/create your own world with it's own functions and rules and story, therefore I started to do that.</p>

    <h2 align="center">John's Animated Weirdness SANDBOX (2021)</h2>
    <p align="center">This was my first published game, which was a sandbox game for my series, John's Animated Weirdness, which ended this past year. You could basically throw the cartoon version of me around and spawn different skins of it.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 align="center">The Liminalverse (2022)</h2>
    <p align="center">This was a game where you could explore different Liminal Spaces, and was going to have much more story to it. However, my old hard drive corrupted, so I lost the files to it, incappable of continuing development on it.</p>
