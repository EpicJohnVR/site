To whoever is reading this, weather you're a curious internet user browsing the files of this website, or anyone who has access to this repository, let me tell you about this.


Epicville was supposed to be a small interactive section of this website, that was just going to be a little village, with houses, stores, etc. I started working on it during Christmas Time 2022, but gave up because CSS was starting to piss me off. If anyone reading this knows CSS very well and could possibly help out, contact me through Discord or Email, and maybe I can bring Epicville back to life.
