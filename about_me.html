  <h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
  <p align="center">My name is John Fiore, and I'm 14 years old, a Freshman in High School. I make Virtual Reality Gaming videos on YouTube, mainly playing a game created by Another Axiom, called Gorilla Tag. But I also play Rec Room, VRChat, etc. I also like to develop video games when I'm not either in school, or doing YouTube. I use the Unity Game Engine, which uitilizes the Progaramming Language of C#. My games tend to be Singleplayer Exploration or Story Games. They're mainly for PC, but I plan on creating console games, such as Xbox, PlayStation, and even VR. My favorite movie is called "Free Guy" (2021), which is about a video game called Free City (modeled after GTA V/Online), and an NPC called "Guy" (Ryan Reynolds), discovering that he is simply a bunch of code. My Favorite Video Games are Grand Theft Auto 5, Gorilla Tag, Rec Room, VRChat, Half-Life 2, and Garry's Mod.</p>

  <h1 align="center">My Goals</h1>
  <p align="center">I would love to reach at least 100K Subscribers on YouTube, make a full length game using unreal engine 4 or 5, meet my favorite celeb, and meet every single one of my fans.</p>
